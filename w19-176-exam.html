<h2 align="center">CS176B - EXAM<br>
<strong>Due:  February 28, 2019 (By 11:59pm)</strong></h2><p></p>


<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>

	<b>Logistics:</b>  this exam is being made available on Wednesday, February 27th at approximately 8:00am.  It is due <i>before</i> Thursday, February 28th at 11:59pm.  Be sure to leave yourself <i>plenty</i> of time to get the exam submitted.
<p>

<b>Goal:</b> the goal is to demonstrate that you have read, digested, and
are able to synthesize the material covered in class.  Keep this in mind as
you try and answer the questions below.
</p><p>

<b>Reference Material:</b>
Also keep in mind that in some cases, more effectively answering the 
questions can be
achieved by finding additional material beyond the class notes.  In
my mind, this is a Good Thing since it will require/allow you to look
for material on the Internet and apply it to what we have learned
in class.  Consider using and referencing (see below) such
material.
</p><p>

<b>Citations:</b>if you do rely on material beyond the class notes
and papers, reference it.  If for no other reason, I'd like to know the 
basis for the answers you write. For your citations, at a minimum, include 
the author, title, date, and URL (if retrieved online) of the reference. 
It's fine if one of these pieces of information cannot be easily 
determined, but include enough information so someone can find what
you looked at.
Citations can be included in-line as part of your answer or as 
footnotes. Whatever way you include the reference, make sure it is 
clear what part of your answer is based on the cited material (i.e., 
do not just include a list of references at the end of your exam).

<b>Quoting Material:</b> 
quoting material from a cited reference is fine, but 
be careful about over-using quotes. If you find you are just quoting 
large blocks of text, you are probably headed in a wrong direction.
</p><p>


<b>Cheating:</b>  as an exam, <i>all</i> work is to be
done individually.  You should not discuss the questions or
answers with anyone else, in the class or otherwise.  If you are
unsure about what a question is asking for, email me, do
not ask your classmates.
</p><p>
</p></ul>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul>

1. What are some of the important questions about Internet route stability 
that Paxson's study did <i>not</i> answer?  How would you go
about designing a set of experiments to collect the data necessary to
answer these questions?  Be specific on what questions you would want
to answer and how you would set up the evaluation to perform the tests.
<p></p><p>

2.  List and briefly describe the metrics used in the two routing
studies described in class.  (A metric is a basis for study or
comparison, e.g., route persistence.)  Identify which metrics were common
to both studies.  Identify a couple of instances where the studies reported
the same findings.  Identify a couple of instances where the studies had
different findings.  For the different findings, provide a brief explanation 
as to why the different studies had different results.
</p><p>

3.  Identify and briefly describe what you believe are the more important 
security flaws in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  Create a Top 5 list
of the most significant and provide a justification for your ranking.
</p><p>

4.  What are the major sources of delay in getting voice data from the 
mouth of a speaker, sent over the Internet, and to the ear of a receiver?
For each source of delay, briefly describe the techniques (to the extent
they exist) for reducing the amount of delay and/or minimizing the impact
of the delay.  Also note any tradeoffs in using any of these techniques.
</p><p>

5.  List and describe the different techniques that can be combined
into a compression standard to reduce the size of a video stream.  If
you need some guidance, use MPEG as an example compression standard
and describe the ways in which it achieves compression.
</p><p>

6.  If you wanted to send an email that was authenticated, integrity
checked, and private (encrypted), what would the steps be?
Answer this question only from
the perspective of steps and <i>not</i> from the perspective of
what specific protocols are currently used in the Internet.  Include 
a basic description of what happens at each step.
</p><p>

7.  Assume one or more students want to corrupt our Gauchospace
exam submission process.
They want to intercept submitted exams, change answers, re-submit
wrong answers on behalf of students and see what other answers students
have submitted so that they can include the best answers as part
of their own submission.  Assume that they would largely do this by
snooping on network packets and possibly man-in-the-middle attacks (as
opposed to attaching to the web server directly).
What specific security mechanisms does Gauchospace use to ensure 
security? Provide the high level details of how the relevant
security protocol(s) work.  And finally, in
your opinion, what would be the weakest link of this whole process?
</p><p>


8. Describe the problem of bufferbloat.  What is it?  What causes it?
When and how does it impact user-perceived performance?  What are
the ways of solving it?  And what are the advantages and disadvantages
of each technique?
</p><p>

9. Briefly describe the process by which a circuit is constructed in
the Tor network.  What information is exchanged at each step? 
What are the major weaknesses in the ability to anonymously
communicate through the Internet using Tor?  In considering these weaknesses
identify how sophisticated an attacker would need to be to exploit
the weakness.
</p></ul>

<h3>Exam Turnin</h3>
<ul>
The exam should be submitted using the course GauchoSpace site.
Your exam should be turned in as a single file that should
be PDF unless you have a really, really good reason not to.  Make
sure your name appears in the PDF.
