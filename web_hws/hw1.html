<strong>Due:  January 27, 2019 (By 11:59pm)</strong></h2><p></p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
This homework is designed to have you explore some of the tools we
discussed in class to better understand the network to which you are
connected.  
<p></p></ul>


<h3> Assignment Details</h3>
<ul>
All of these tools should be available on any machine running a UNIX-based
operating system, i.e. the machines in CSIL.  Many are also available on non-UNIX machines, but the syntax may vary.  You will want to make 
extensive use of the <i>man pages</i> for each command (either via the command line or via the Internet).<p>

</p><h4>A. ifconfig or ipconfig</h4>

<ol>
	<li> Determine the network interface configuration of the machine you are using (e.g., "<i>ifconfig -a</i>" or "<i>ipconfig /all</i>").  Capture the
output (screenshot) and include it as part of your answer.  Identify and explain as much of 
what is printed as you can.

</li><li> Using the "<i>ip</i>" command in Unix, what command would you enter to get similarly detailed information? For example, "ip xxxxx"
<p>
</p></li></ol>

<h4>B. ARP</h4>

<ol>
<li> Run "<i>arp -a</i>" on your machine.  Capture 
the output (screenshot) and include it as part of your answer.  Explain each part of what is printed.<p>

</p></li><li> If you try to use the <i>arp</i> command to add or delete an entry to the 
ARP table, what happens? Why do you suppose this the case?<p>

</p></li><li> There is another indirect way of affecting the contents of the ARP table.
How can you affect (either add, delete, or change) entries in the ARP table? 
Use this mechanism to add at least two new hosts to the ARP table and capture
the output (screenshot) of the new ARP table and include it as part of your answer.<p>

</p></li><li> How long do entries stay cached in the ARP table?  Describe a
trail-and-error method to discover the timeout value.<p>

</p></li><li> How is the output of "<i>arp -a</i>" different from "<i>ip neighbor</i>"?
<p>

</p></li><li> What will happen if two different IP addresses assigned to each of two different hosts both map to the same Ethernet address?
Be specific on how hosts on the subnet operate and respond.<p>

</p></li></ol>

<h4>C. traceroute</h4>

<ol>
<li> Explain in detail how <i>traceroute</i> works.<p>

</p></li><li> Perform a <i>traceroute</i> from your machine to <i>jnto.org.au</i>. Include a copy
of the output and explain what happened including a description of what
each of the fields means.<p>

</p></li><li> Perform some other <i>traceroutes</i>.  Include a copy of the traceroute that completed successfully and had the most number of hops.
<p>

</p></li><li> Here's the challenge for this question:  we want to traceroute to a 
non-existent machine outside
of UCSB.  The first problem is how do we KNOW that a particular machine does
not exist?  If we just pick an IP address and <i>ping</i> it, why is that
not sufficient?<p>

</p></li><li> Determine an IP address for a machine that you know definitely does not exist (but is still a valid public IP address in the Class A, B, or C range).  Explain how you determined that the IP address you chose is not being used.
Do a <i>traceroute</i> to that machine.  Include a copy of the result.<p>

</p></li><li> Identify a completely different (for all four parts of the IP address) IP address for a non-existent
machine.  Do a traceroute to this machine.  Include a copy of this result.<p>

</p></li><li> Repeat the above exercise (but you don't have to include traceroutes to
more than two machines in your writeup) enough times so you can detect a 
pattern about what is happening.  What pattern exists and why?<p>

</p></li><li> What is <i>tracepath</i> and how is it different than <i>traceroute</i>?

</li></ol>

<h4> D. Router Looking Glass</h4>
<ol>

<li>Use "http://alice.ja.net" to show the route from this router (from the drop-down menu) to UCSB (resolve the domain and provide its IP as the argument).  Explain as much of the output as possible--use Google to learn about the information displayed.
<p>

</p></li><li>Use "http://alice.ja.net" to perform a traceroute to 128.111.1.1.  Include a copy of the output.
</li></ol>


<h4> E. netstat (or ss)</h4>

<ol>

<li> What is <i>netstat</i> (or ss) and what is it used for?<p>

</p></li><li> What parameters for <i>netstat</i> (or <i>ss</i>) should you use to show all the TCP 
connections established? Include a printout of this list for your machine.
Be sure to explain what all fields are.<p>

</p></li><li> What option of <i>netstat</i> (or <i>ss</i>) can be used to display network interface status? 
By using <i>netstat</i> (or <i>ss</i>), figure out the number of interfaces
on your machine.  In the output you will find an interface named "<i>lo0</i>"
as a loopback interface. What is this interface, and what are some of the ways it is useful?<p>
</p></li></ol>

<h4>F. nslookup (or dig)</h4>

<ol>

<li> What is the IP address for the machine <i>cs.princeton.edu</i>?<p>

</p></li><li> What <i>local</i> DNS server is this information coming from? How does your computer know to
use this DNS server?  <p>

</p></li><li> Here is the problem: I want to find the IP address of where my email 
to "<i>somebody@hotmail.com</i>" goes. What you really need to do is find the 
<i>mail exchanger</i>
for <i>hotmail.com</i>. There is an option in <i>nslookup</i> (or <i>dig</i>) that tells you what the mail
exchanger is for <i>hotmail.com</i>. Figure out the exact syntax of the format of
this command, and execute it. Now what is the IP address of where my email
to <i>hotmail.com</i> goes?<p>

</p></li></ol>

<h4>G. whois</h4>
<ol>

<li> Who is the administrative contact for the ucsb.edu network?
<p>

</p></li><li> The host "<i>morticia.cc.gatech.edu</i>" is not in the whois database, but its IP address is.  What is the address of the organization that manages this machine?
<p>

</p></li><li> If the host "<i>wave3.mit.edu</i>" is being used to attack my machine.  Who should I call and what is their phone number?<p>

</p></li><li> Like the hotmail example, I have another friend I send email to at gmail.
Her email address is "<i>something@gmail.com</i>"  What can you say about
the coordinator for the gmail network, i.e. contact info, etc?
Include information about the steps you took and the
results of the queries you made to figure out this information.<p>

</p></li><li> What company owns IP address 198.182.196.56?   What machines act
as the DNS nameserver for the domain that 198.182.196.56 is in?<p>
</p></li></ol>

<h4>H. Misc</h4>

<ol>

<li> Do a DNS lookup for whitehouse.gov?  What IP address is returned?  If you enter
that IP address into the browser bar of a browser, what happens?<p>

</p></li><li> If you enter "whitehouse.gov" into the browser bar of a browser, what happens?  Explain
any differences between what happened in the previous question and for this question.<p>

</p></li><li> To whom is the appropriate person to send abuse complaints related to whitehouse.gov's
web site?  Comment on the domain of this person's IP address.<p>

</p></li><li> To whom is the appropriate person to send abuse complaints related to whitehouse.gov's
email system?  Comment on the domain of this person's IP address.<p>

</p></li></ol>

</ul>
