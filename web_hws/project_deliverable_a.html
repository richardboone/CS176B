<strong>Due:  January 20, 2019 (By 11:59pm)</strong></h2><p></p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
Part of the focus of this class is to do a fair amount of network
programming.  However, instead of simply picking a particular project
for everyone to pursue, I'm turning this into a modestly open-ended
project.  
<p>

The objective of this assignment is to have you develop a project
proposal, the first part for your quarter project.  Based on your ideas, 
you are to write up a description of a proposal sufficient that the TA and I can
provide feedback on:  (i) the creativity of the idea, (ii) the feasibility
of the idea, and (iii) potential pitfalls in executing the project
plan.
</p></ul>


<h3> Assignment Details</h3>
<ul>

The project is intended to be as open-ended and flexible as possible given
the constraints of a 10 week quarter.  The idea is to give you the opportunity 
to explore a particular topic of interest and as a way to think more deeply 
about the topics we will cover this quarter. 
<p>

As described above in the goals, the TA and I need to see sufficient detail
to be able to evaluate the quality of your idea and its feasibility.
Further, the more you plan up front, the less uncertainty there will
be when it comes to implementing your ideas.  That said, every proposal is just that:  a
proposal.  No doubt at least someone (or some team) will run into issues that will require
a change of plans.  NOTE:  changes to the proposal will not negatively affect 
your grade if you are able to sufficiently explain what happened.
</p><p>

We will talk about project ideas in class, but let me provide a few ideas to
get your started.  These include:

</p><ul>
	<li> An application-layer protocol of some sort, for example, 
some kind of registration server to support coordination required by an
application.  For example, multi-player games use a server to ping
clients for network performance in deciding how to group game players.
This project would require designing a protocol header and then deciding
what kind of information to exchange.

</li><li> An idea that would require a similar kind of implementation would
	be to develop some new version of TCP reliability or congestion control.

</li><li> Moving of the protocol stack, you can also implement any of a wide
	variety of applications.  For example, a secure chat application that
	uses some of the security concepts we will learn about in class.  Another
	option is to build a streaming media server where your focus is on 
	the streaming protocol and buffer management.

</li><li> Implement a bundle protocol for relaying content in a Disruption
	Tolerant Network (DTN) scenario.

</li><li> Implement a proxy server where your project implementation
	receives packets, manipulates them in some way, and then
	forwards them along a network link.  You can use an idea
	like this to implement a basic firewall, a network
	emulator (for example, by introducing delay, loss, and jitter),
	some sort of network-based man-in-the-middle attack, your
	own version of a NAT gateway, or an encapsulation protocol to
	provide encryption similar to what IPSec does.
</li></ul>
<br>

This list is intended only to get you started.  Any idea is fair game
as long as it allows you to (1) demonstrate network programming concepts,
(2) learn some new aspect of network programming, and (3) successfully
create a deliverable that shows the TA and me successful application of
the concepts we are studying in class.
<p>
</p></ul>

<h3> Overview of Project Milestones/Deliverables</h3>
<ul>

As part of the project planning process and to briefly give you
some insight into how the project is structured, first keep in mind
that there will be three deliverables:  (1) this project proposal,
(2) a midterm project report, and (3) a
final project report.  Over the first couple of lectures and in the
discussion sections taught by Paul, we will be providing
additional detail.
<p>

The midterm project report will be an update to this project
proposal but with more details about what you are doing and
an update on what you have accomplished so far.
</p><p>

The final deliverable will include the source code for your
project.  But understand that even with programming projects, source 
code is typically not the only deliverable.  For example, if you were
working at a company, you would do more than just send your boss
a gzip of source code files.  You would (and will) want to include a 
report.
</p><p>

We will talk more about what you can include that has the best
chance of helping us understand your project, but it is worth
thinking about some of its high-level aspects now.  
Also consider that at least some projects
will have an aspect beyond source code.  For example, 
there is a on "performance evaluation."  If you have a project
that seeks to answer a particular question (e.g., is my TCP
congestion control algorithm better than New Reno?), you may
need to include performance graphs and some additional analysis.
Give some thought to what you will deliver at the end of the quarter
for us to grade.  
</p><p>
</p></ul>

<h3>Project Proposal Details</h3>
<ul>
In terms of what you need to submit for this first project plan, it
needs to include more than just a description of
what you want to do.  In many instances, it also requires some 
investigation or research to determine if your ideas are feasible.
For example, if you wish to implement a basic version of TCP 
congestion control, you will need to investigate whether
you have the platform (and permissions)
to develop such a project.
If you are interested in implementing a YouTube-style buffer management
scheme, you first have to gather information on how YouTube-style
buffer management works (preferably beyond simply observing how it
works).  As part of your project plan, you will want to include a
description of what investigation you have done.
<p>

One of the issues you will want to address in your
proposal is the idea of "incremental deliverables" in order to avoid a failure
to complete the assignment.  In the end, you will not be
penalized for failure to fully complete a project that was more
difficult than envisioned, but you will need to demonstrate a deep
commitment of time to executing your plan.  One particularly effective
way of demonstrating this commitment is to show incremental
progress.  Using the TCP congestion control implementation project as an 
example, the goal should not be an all-or-nothing effort, but the demonstration 
of at least partial success will show what you were able to accomplish
and what caused a lack of further progress.
</p><p>

Projects can be done individually or in groups of two.  While a group size
of 2 is not a strict limit, anything larger than 2 will have to be well
justified.  The project proposal will need to provide a justification for
a group of more than two students, but I would strongly encourage you to
contact me soon if you are thinking of having a project team with more than
two members.
</p><p>

<b>Misc Note</b>:  I do not mind overlapping this project with a
project from another class (e.g., CS 189A/B).  But the project
must fit within the requirements of this course, and you must
outline in your proposal how what you are doing for this class is
above and beyond (or simply different) than the other class, i.e., 
no 100% overlap.
</p><p>

</p></ul>

<h3> Specific Project Proposal Deliverable</h3>
<ul>

To be specific, while your project proposal can take any form you wish
(as long as it gets the job done of describing your idea), the
following summarizes what I think are the important parts:

<ul>
<li> Title
</li><li> Project Member(s):  remember to include a justification if you
want 3 group members (&gt;3 not allowed unless you think you have a
stupendous justification).
</li><li> Project Description:  including supporting evidence of your
feasibility investigation as described above.  For information
sources on which you rely to develop your project, include 
a bibliography and citations.
</li><li> Deliverables:  what you expect to turn in
</li><li> Timeline:  timeline of tasks
</li></ul>
<p>

Finally, as for project ideas, if you find yourself
struggling, email me with what thoughts you do have--or come to office
hours.  Do it sooner rather than later.  In addition to my help, you
will want to communicate with Paul.  He will be providing feedback
and doing the grading.  Ensure that he has a good understanding of
your goals, and eventually, what you have accomplished.
</p><p>
</p></ul>

<h3>Assignment Turnin</h3>
<ul>
The assignment should be submitted using the course GauchoSpace site.
Note: the turnin time on GauchoSpace is set to 12:00am of the day
after assignment is due, but note this is a difference of 1 minute:
11:59pm of one day and 12:00am of the next.  Do not be confused by 
this one minute difference--the assignment is due at the end of the 
day listed at the top of the assignment. 
<p>

Your project proposal should be turned in as a single file that should
be PDF unless you have a really, really good reason not to.
If you have a project group, <i>only one</i>
group member should turn in an assignment.</p><p>
</p></ul>

<h3><span>Cheating Policy </span></h3>
    <ul>
Despite my own inability to figure out how to cheat on this 
assignment, someone might spend the energy to try and do so.  But be 
warned, I take cheating very seriously, and any such attempt will not
be tolerated. 
Please read the <a href="http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/regulations/"><i>UCSB
		                Academic Code of Conduct</i></a>
to find out more about Student Conduct and Discipline. As always,
if there is something that might be interpreted as cheating, ask
questions in advance.  Also as always, any materials on which you
rely for ideas or as part of an implementation should be properly
cited.
